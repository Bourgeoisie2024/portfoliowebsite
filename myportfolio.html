        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Al-Ameen Olawale Bakare, and I am 31 years old. I am a native of Lagos State, Nigeria. I attended St. John Primary School and Wahab Folawiyo High School in Lagos State, and I graduated from the Department of Political Science at Ekiti State University in Ekiti State, Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p>During my mandatory post-graduation 1-Year National Youth Service Corps Programme, I worked as a teacher, where I taught students about good governance, civic rights and duties, among several other topics, adhering to the curriculum. I have long been passionate about learning tech, realizing how exponential technological innovations and advancements can transform human lives and change how things are done. The prospect of more job opportunities, attractive financial rewards, flexible working schedules, and a conducive working environment that provides an avenue to collaborate with a focused and driven team of like-minded individuals also made the tech industry attractive to me.
        </p>
        <p>After deciding to learn tech, I began researching how I could learn on my own until I stumbled upon an online IDE on one of the popular tech learning platforms, where I was expected to start writing and rendering code. It then dawned on me that there are indeed languages I must learn to communicate with the computer. I knew there were people who had the information and knowledge I needed, so it became a challenge for me to choose the right teacher, and I did find one.
        </p>
        <p>I then became a Full-stack Web Developer, Author of "Manuals for Absolute Beginners," and an alumna of Djtconcept. I was inspired to write the "Manuals for Absolute Beginners" to help others who desire to learn tech, even with no experience. The project was undertaken in collaboration with Mr. David Oshin of Djtconcept, and these manuals have since been adopted by the foremost IT learning enterprise in Nigeria in 2024.
        </p>
        <p>Apart from my contributions to the tech field as an author, I also became the Founder of Nimala. Kindly visit [nimala.ng]. Nimala is an online platform that offers digital solutions to businesses, teaches tech and language skills courses, and provides fire-safety-related products and services.
        </p>
        <p>I am also a Fire-safety Consultant with adequate experience from my time working with the Lagos State Fire Service, Lagos State, Nigeria. I led a team of 15 members who carried out fire safety inspections of three Local Government Areas of Lagos State and helped facilitate the issuance of Fire Safety Compliance Certificates for thousands of businesses.
        </p>
        <p>My passion for traveling and understanding cultures beyond the shores of my hometown has also made me a polyglot. My passion for lifelong continuous learning is the same reason why I applied for a Power Learn Project Scholarship, which presents me with the chance to take a Software Engineering Course at no cost. I am very grateful for the opportunity and have indeed learned more than I expected from PLP.
